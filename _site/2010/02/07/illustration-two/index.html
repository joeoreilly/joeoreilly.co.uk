        <div class="entry"><p>I now want to build on the things I've learnt while creating my first illustration.</p>

<h3>The Monster wants a Wife</h3>

<p>The second illustration in my <em>evolutionary</em> series will feature two characters. The towering monster standing proud looking down at a seething Dr. Frankenstein. The monster has just come running at him, asking for a companion to ease his loneliness.</p>

<blockquote><p>As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance, advancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the crevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me, but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. I perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!) that it was the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in mortal combat. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.<br/></p>

<p>&lsquo;Devil,&rsquo; I exclaimed, &lsquo;do you dare approach me? And do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head? Begone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! And, oh! That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!&rsquo;<br/></p>

<p>&lsquo;I expected this reception,&rsquo; said the daemon. &lsquo;All men hate the wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life? Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind. If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>an excerpt from <strong>Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus</strong> Chapter 10</p>

<h3>Abhorred monster!</h3>

<p>I already had in mind one photograph from my set that would suit the purposes of this piece perfectly. Eyes looking down, the slightest hint of forward momentum.</p>

<p><img src="/media/images/contactsheets/sheet1/image-16.jpg"></p>

<p>Ignore the temporary background, it's to give me something to look at rather than the original image.</p>

<p><img src="/media/images/frank-illustration-12.png"></p>

<p>I started on the trousers.</p>

<p><a onmouseover="document.trousers.src='/media/images/frank-illustration-13b.png'" onmouseout="document.trousers.src='/media/images/frank-illustration-13a.png'"><img name="trousers" src="/media/images/frank-illustration-13a.png"><p class="caption">Mouse over to see shading</p></a></p>

<p><br/></p>

<p><a onmouseover="document.step2.src='/media/images/frank-illustration-14b.png'" onmouseout="document.step2.src='/media/images/frank-illustration-14a.png'"><img name="step2" src="/media/images/frank-illustration-14a.png"><p class="caption">Mouse over to see shapes</p></a></p>

<p>I moved swiftly from then jumper onto the hands. First left.</p>

<p><img src="/media/images/frank-illustration-15-1.png" alt="" />
<img src="/media/images/frank-illustration-15-2.png" alt="" />
<img src="/media/images/frank-illustration-15-3.png" alt="" />
<img src="/media/images/frank-illustration-15-4.png" alt="" />
<img src="/media/images/frank-illustration-15-5.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then right.</p>

<p><img src="/media/images/big-hand.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then the hair and face.</p>

<p><img src="/media/images/frank-illustration-16.png" alt="" />
<img src="/media/images/frank-illustration-17.png" alt="" />
<img src="/media/images/frank-illustration-18.png" alt="" />
<img src="/media/images/frank-illustration-19.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2>The Finished Result</h2>

<p><a href="/media/images/illustration-two-large.png" rel="milkbox" title="The Finished Article"><img src="/media/images/illustration-two.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I also created a version with yellow skin, black lips and hair like Mary Shelly described the monster.</p>
