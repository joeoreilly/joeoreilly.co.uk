	<h2>Detailed Project Proposal</h2>
	
	<h3>Location Aware Personal Assistant App</h3>

	<p><span>Summary</span> - An iOS App that will provide both user and automatically generated data based on current location, and present it on a map or listing screen.</p>

	<h4>Project Description</h4>
	
	<p>I am going to create an iOS App targeted against iOS 7 that will run on both the iPhone and iPad. The App will be written in Objective-C using Xcode on Mac OS X. The App will provide the user information based on their location. This information can be entered by the user and recalled when near the associated location or automatically generated from web searches. Some of the kinds of data that will be, collected are; web links, documents, apps, address book contacts, attractions or travel information, and text notes. The data that is loaded will depend on the location of the user’s device.</p>
	
	<h4>Tasks</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Create detailed UML class, use case, sequence, and state diagrams for the App.</li>
		<li>Create a detailed development plan for the App.</li>
		<li>Design and code UI to add, manage, and display user defined points of interest.</li>
		<li>Design and code UI to view geographically relevant points of interest.</li>
		<li>Design and code UI to view a point of interest in more detail.</li>
		<li>Write an algorithm to parse locally stored points of interest.</li>
		<li>Write an algorithm to parse remote data sources for relevant local information.</li>
		<li>Write an algorithm to group points of interest into groups based on location. </li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Deliverables</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Full application specification.</li>
		<li>UML class, case, sequence, and state diagrams.</li>
		<li>A detailed development plan.</li>
		<li>A build of the app that allows a user to enter data about points of interest and then presents these predefined points of interest at a the appropriate locations.</li>
		<li>A build of the App that shows predefined user data for a given location alongside data automatically generated for the same location.</li>
		<li>Submit the App to the iOS App store for Approval and sale.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Demonstration</h4>

	<p>I will provide a short, roughly 5 minute, demo of the application on a test device with some sample data. This will include adding and removing points of interest as well as a short demo of the web point of interest scraping. I will also preform a further demo using the iOS Application Simulator, as this allows me to fake my location so I can demo the app on the move, I will show how POIs are updated as the device moves and how users can receive notifications for certain types of POIs.</p>

	<h4>Background</h4>
	<p>Currently I have not used iOS’s location or mapping APIs so I will be reading the class reference and programming guides for CoreLocation and MapKit from Apple Developer.  I will also be investigating Google and DuckDuckGo’s  web search APIs. I am also going to research quad trees as a method of more usefully displaying my map data. I also plan to make use of AFNetworking a popular open source iOS networking library as and BugShotKit an in app screen capture and bug reporting tool.
