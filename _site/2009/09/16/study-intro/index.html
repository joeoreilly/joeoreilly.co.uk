        <div class="entry"><h2>A contextual study on the effect early Black and White Photography has had on modern artists and their work</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>In the beginning - In the early 20th century the camera, an invention from the 19th century, was becoming a popular tool for capturing moments of time within a near perfect monochrome print. Where we would have previously commissioned a portrait or simply written about important events, with the revolution of the camera we could now see an exact replica of one selected moment in time. This moment of time has been selected by a photographer, the photographer was now becoming a new kind of artist. An artist who selects from the countless possibilities, a beautiful range of lights and darks creatively cropping objects of less importance while giving focus to those with more.</p>

<p>We often see black and white as an old media, reflecting the years gone by. It is however still a very modern form of art. As it was nearly 300 years ago that the first silver nitrate cameras where created and examples of conscious human art have been dated to as far back as 40,000 years ago. Early art like very simple cave paintings and later small figures was directly influenced by real life. As art developed over time, the sources of influence changed. Artists, people who create images or form with no function other to stimulate thought, where influenced by those before them.</p>

<p>Artists for discussion - The artist Brassa&iuml; practiced photography in Paris in the 1930s, I think as his work was influenced by earlier photographers before him as well as classic art and his contemporary photographers. I will base a large area of my study on the things that impacted his style and his work. I will also look at an artist who uses lots of colour in his work, this artist is called Kenneth Noland, and he is a colour field painter who creates paintings with big areas of colour.</p>

<p>Finally I will compare the work of Brassa&iuml; to a contemporary artist. He is photographer called Andrew Lynch, who shots mainly in black and white and lives in New York city. I will contact him and talk to him personally about his work to get a unique perspective into it. I hope that talking to Andrew Lynch will give me an insight into his work. Allowing me to create an amazing comparison with Brassa&iuml; and Paris, Andrew Lynch and New York and Me and London.</p>

<p>By comparing these artists I hope to be able to make some predictions as to what I think will happen in the future of Black and White art. I will experiment with various different photographic media and create some fascinating black and white art of my own in London, using both modern and ancient photographic techniques in response to Brassa&iuml;, Kenneth Noland and Andrew Lynch.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on my first draft</h3>

<p>There are some areas that have a large amount of detail regarding the history of Photography that I will probably move into my first chapter. I also think some of the language is obfuscated and could do with being rewritten in a neater fashion.</p>
