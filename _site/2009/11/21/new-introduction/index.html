<p>Icons in the modern world are symbols that hold meaning beyond just their image. As an avid computer user I interact with icons every day on both the internet and my desktop. However icons don't just exist in the digital world. They are also used nearly everywhere around us. Think for example every time you go to the toilet or use an elevator, you see icons that are globally understood.</p>

<p>An illustration is a visualisation such as a drawing, painting, photograph or other work of art that stresses subject more than form. Illustration is a method of adding meaning or ornamentation to something textual. As humans we are taught from a very young age the meaning of various symbols. These symbols have been developed over thousands of years. The first icons can be traced back roughly 32,000 years, to hand art that was created in caves by ancient humans.</p>

<p>These icons where messages to fellow humans as a method to pass on information about their surroundings. For example we see images of packs of animals on the walls of caves, we can assume that these would be used to suggest that those particular animals live nearby. There are large levels of details present in the animals we can recognise even today.</p>

<p>In the first chapter of my study I want to investigate the ways that iconic images have influenced contemporary illustration. First I will look at early cave art and the means of some of the symbols. I will also look for modern equivalents to cave art, for example graffiti and street art. I am then going to do some research into human development with the hope that I can understand the importance symbols have within the mind.</p>

<p>In the second chapter I am going to research an artist who has created images with strong symbolic meanings. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Schwabe">Carlos Schwabe</a> creates images that are full of deep symbolic meaning. I want to develop an understanding of his work by studying a pice of it in detail, and possibly contrasting his work to other artists.</p>

<p>I will use chapter three as an opportunity to look at a media I'm not familiar with, such as film and video, sculpture or even watercolour and see what if any influences they've had upon contemporary illustration.</p>

<p>In chapter four I will study a contemporary illustrator who also uses symbolism in his work. I will study <a href="http://www.danhillier.com/">Dan Hillier</a> an illustrator who I talked to in Brick Lane Market where I also saw his work in October this year. His work is full of symbols in the forms of human and animal skeletons, tentacles, ornate patterns and Victorian attire.</p>

<p><img src="/media/images/hilliar.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Finally I will summarise my research, studies and work into an answer for the question.</p>

<blockquote><p>How Have Symbolic Images Influenced Contemporary Illustration?</p></blockquote>
