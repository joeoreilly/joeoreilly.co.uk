		<p>In London we visited the Gay Icons Exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery. In one of the gallery halls the space had been filled with portraits of people who where either famous for being gay, or somehow related to homosexuality. The group as a whole felt angry that one man had been left out of the exhibition. This inspired what has become one of my favourite illustrations, and has taken up countless hours.</p> <h2>Stephen Fry</h2> <p><img src="/media/images/stephen.png" alt="" /></p> <h3>As I'm Sure You Can Imagine I Plan to Show the Steps!</h3> <p>I used Google Image search and found an image...
