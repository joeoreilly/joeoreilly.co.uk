	<h2>Project Proposal</h2>
	
	<h3>Location Aware Personal Assistant App</h3>

	<h4>Project Aims</h4>
	
	<p>I aim to create an iOS App targeted against iOS 7 that will run on both the iPhone and iPad. The App will provide a user information based on their location, wether that be user defined data or automatically generated. This data could be, but isn&rsquo;t limited to, any of the following; web links, documents, apps, address book contacts, attractions or travel information. The data will load only when the user&rsquo;s device is within a predefined geographic area.
	Having spent my placement year writing iOS Apps, I am familiar with CocoaTouch. I haven&rsquo;t, however, written any networking code and think that will be an interesting experience and could prove to be where a large slice of development time ends up being spent.</p>


	<h4>Tasks</h4>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Perform requirements elicitation</li>
		<li>Create a detailed specification for the App to follow.</li>
		<li>Create detailed UML class, use case, and state diagrams for the App.</li>
		<li>Create a detailed development plan for the App.</li>
		<li>Create user interfaces to add, manage and display user defined points of interest.</li>
		<li>Create a user interface to view geographically relevant points of interest.</li>
		<li>Create a user interface to view a point of interest in more detail.</li>
		<li>Create an algorithm that parses various data sources for useful local information.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Deliverables</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>App specification</li>
		<li>UML Diagrams</li>
		<li>Development plan</li>
		<li>Produce an App that shows predefined user data at a given location.</li>
		<li>Produce an App that shows predefined user data for a given location alongside data automatically generated for the same location.</li>
		<li>Submit the App to the iOS App store for Approval and sale.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Assessment Criteria</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The specification should fully cover the App's feature set and data model.</li>
		<li>The produced UML should be consistent with the App.</li>
		<li>The App works on the iPhone</li>
		<li>The App works on the iPad</li>
		<li>The App has a functional user interface that allows managing of points of interest.</li>
		<li>The App shows the correct predefined information at each/any location.</li>
		<li>The App shows relevant automatically generated information at any location where data is available.</li>
		<li>The App doesn't crash or exhibit strange behaviour, i.e. is relatively bug free</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>The Problem</h4>

	<p>Currently bookmarks, address book contacts, and other information available on smartphones and tablets is presented to a user in a static format that doesn't adapt to where the user is. This means users have to spend time searching for information that could be prepared and displayed for them based on their current location.</p>


	<h4>Why This Interests Me</h4>
	<p>I travel from home to University five days a week and find myself constantly switching between two 'contexts' which is currently hard to manage. Solving this with an App makes double sense, I'm using the device anyway and I worked as an iOS Developer in my placement.</p>

	<h4>How I choose this problem</h4>
	<p>I spent the last 12 months writing every idea, no matter how nutty, that came into my head down and this was the one I liked the most and had not seen anywhere else.</p>


	<h4>Methods &amp; Processes</h4>
	<p>I will use make use of object oriented design, test driven development, continuous integration, and version control.</p>

	<h4>Systems, Applications, and Tools</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Xcode to develop the App</li>
		<li>Mac OS X Server for running tests and perform continuous integration</li>
		<li>Git for version control.</li>
		<li>Photoshop and Illustrator for design, image editing, and image creation.</li>
		<li>OmniGraffle to produce all UML diagrams</li>
		<li>Pages to produce App Specification</li>
	</ul>
