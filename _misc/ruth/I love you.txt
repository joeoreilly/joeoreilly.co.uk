Ruth,

I love you so much, not one single thing I've done in my life has made me worthy of the person you are. I can't fathom how lucky I am, that I get to be with you everyday. I've never truly shown you the love you deserve. I hope you understand that I've always loved you even when I didn't say it, or show it, or even act like it.

I am forever yours,
Joe
