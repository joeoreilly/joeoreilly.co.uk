### My German Friend Hans

I decided it would be good to practice this new illustration technique with a smaller target. I snapped a few photos of my hand that I could use,

<a href="/media/images/hands/hand-large-01.jpg" rel="milkbox:gallery" title="My Hand" onmouseover="document.hand1.src='/media/images/hands/hand-01b.png'" onmouseout="document.hand1.src='/media/images/hands/hand-01.png'" ><img name="hand1" src="/media/images/hands/hand-01.png" /></a>
<a href="/media/images/hands/hand-large-02.jpg" rel="milkbox:gallery" title="My Hand" onmouseover="document.hand2.src='/media/images/hands/hand-02b.png'" onmouseout="document.hand2.src='/media/images/hands/hand-02.png'" ><img name="hand2" src="/media/images/hands/hand-02.png" /></a>
<a href="/media/images/hands/hand-large-03.jpg" rel="milkbox:gallery" title="My Hand" onmouseover="document.hand3.src='/media/images/hands/hand-03b.png'" onmouseout="document.hand3.src='/media/images/hands/hand-03.png'" ><img name="hand3" src="/media/images/hands/hand-03.png" /></a>

I opened the photos in Illustrator and started to work.

I created the usual layers I would usually create and began to work.

<a onmouseover="document.allgonewrong.src='/media/images/hands/illustrator-02b.png'" onmouseout="document.allgonewrong.src='/media/images/hands/illustrator-02a.png'">
<img src="/media/images/hands/illustrator-02a.png" name="allgonewrong"/>
</a>

This image however wasn't really working very well, so I decided to switch to one of the others. I'm not sure what was wrong with it exactly but I kept having to change what I'd done and I wasn't getting the look I wanted.
