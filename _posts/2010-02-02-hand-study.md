### My German Friend Hans

I decided it would be good to practice this new illustration technique with a smaller target. I snapped a few photos of my hand that I could use,

<a href="/media/images/hands/hand-large-01.jpg"><img alt="Hand 1" src="/media/images/hands/hand-01.png"/></a>
<a href="/media/images/hands/hand-large-02.jpg"><img alt="Hand 2" src="/media/images/hands/hand-02.png"/></a>
<a href="/media/images/hands/hand-large-03.jpg"><img alt="Hand 3" src="/media/images/hands/hand-03.png"/></a>

I opened the photos in Illustrator and started to work.

I created the usual layers I would usually create and began to work.

<img src="/media/images/hands/illustrator-02a.png" name="allgonewrong" onmouseover="document.allgonewrong.src='/media/images/hands/illustrator-02b.png'" onmouseout="document.allgonewrong.src='/media/images/hands/illustrator-02a.png'">

This image however wasn't really working very well, so I decided to switch to one of the others. I'm not sure what was wrong with it exactly but I kept having to change what I'd done and I wasn't getting the look I wanted.
