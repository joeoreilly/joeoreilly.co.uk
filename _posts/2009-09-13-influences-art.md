I went in search of some pieces of Clasic art that have either influenced later works, or been directly referenced.

[Banksy](http://www.banksy.co.uk/), known for his stark outlook on society has remixed this painting by Jack Vettriano. The dancers remain unchanged, however there are now two men in chemical hazard suits doing what apears to be dumping "Crude Oil" In the background of the painting there is a tanker, that has broken in half in the sea. The Banksy paiting is clearly a direct response to the original.
