After a change of heart with regards to my [old title](/2009/09/22/study-title/) my [personal work](/work/) has taken a new direction towards illustration and graphic design.

# Possible New Titles

* What is illustration?
* How has illustration changed contempary art?
* How do iconographic images influence contemporary illustration?

I have decided to use the title, *How do iconographic images influence contemporary illustration?* for my study. I will use this as the tag line for the main title.

<h1 style="font-size: 600%; margin: 0;">Iconic Illustration</h1>
<h3 style="font-size: 150%;">How have symbolic images influenced contemporary illustration?</h3>
