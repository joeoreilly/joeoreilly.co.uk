Lichtenstein was an American pop artist who was born in 1929 in Manhattan. He worked with oil and Magna paint. His works where comentaries on the way mass media portrys his theme, he used comic strips created by others as the basis for much of his work. They rarely recive any credit. I like Lichtenstein because of the strong influence of colour in his work, without it the paintings lose there emotion. Mouse over right to see black and white.


You could say that Lichtenstein was stealing the emotion from the comic book artists, and crafting it into his own work. This is deeply contrasted to the way Brassa&iuml; worked, his photographs are uniuqe. While it is the nature of a photograph to be totally uniuqe, his seem rich and filled with power, even without the colours he would have seen through the view finder.


In response to Roy Lichtenstein's work I have re-imagined one of Brassa&iuml;'s photographs using Illustrator. This took me roughly two hours to create and I spent 30 minutes chosing a good image of Brassa&iuml;'s to use.

I used the simple black outlines that Lichtenstein's work became well known for, however as my original image had no colour the image lacked the harsh emotions of some of Lichtenstein or Brassa&iuml;'s great work.
