After being tasked with buying a magazine that I wouldn't normally read I purchased Star magazine. Priced at 85p it doesn't really win any prizes for high qualitly type setting. It does even make any real effort with regards to layout. I decided to redesign the cover and several spreads from inside.

The front page of Star has a handful of issues.

* there is no obvious pallette beside primary colours
* way to many different type faces and ALL CAPS
* messy layout 
* to much focus on price
* the Star logo is hidden and obscured

My first step for my redesign was to update the star logo, the red in the text doesn't really mean anything. Red is often associated with anger, hate, violence, <a href="http://www.heatworld.com/">heat</a>, passion, love and lust. I think it is often just a colour people pick when no thought is going into a design.

I used a very simple concept. I changed the type face to Futura and replaced the gap in the 'A' with a small ★ glyph. I decided to keep the logo black here for presentational means, however it will also apear in white where needed.

I created a very simple front page using the golden selection to divide the page in half. The star title and barcode go tço the right in the smaller section and the Jordan! headline is on the left in the larger one. I decided to stick with just one image on the front page, as before Star seemed to want to shove as much down our throats as possible. I think this increases readability and improves the overall look of the magazine.

The front page was a small task compared with the inside of the magazine, I decided that I could produce original art work in the form of an illustration, I will  also include photographs of Victoria Beckham so as not to alienate current readers.

I started a simple illustration that I could use for my new spread, it is based on a photograph of Victoria Beckham.

It only took me 6 hours to complete this illustration of Posh Spice.

Here is my final composition. I used a really simple gird on the right hand page and a large illustration on the left page to contrast. I chose Helvetica for a type face as it works well for readability and at small sizes.
