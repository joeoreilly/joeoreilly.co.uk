### Light - Shadow - Perspective

I started off borrowing a large plasters uplighter from a friend of my Dad. We then proceeded to mess about with it in the garden taking photographs of the shadows we could create on objects we had to hand. Here are my favourite 19 photographs.

## People &amp; Objects

The first photographic session didn't inspire me to create anything particularly interesting, but I set my mind in motion. I began thinking about what a shadow was, is it merely a silhouette on a surface caused by our bodies coming in between that surface and an emmiter of photons. Or is it a metaphysical simplified representation of ourselves that's constantly changing throughout the day. I'm took my camera and jumped on the bus to Uxbridge to find out. I started to take photos of people moving, trying to get a person to almost leave their shadow behind.

I set my camera to shoot in bursts of three, so I could keep still between exposures. This would be essential for what I planned to create later.

I didn't limit myself to just images that I thought I could use I also tried to take some really nice images of the shadows in the afternoon sun.

### Experimenting in Photoshop

I fired up Photoshop and went of to make a cup of tea as I have so many brushes and fonts it takes about 5 minutes to load them all. When I came back I plugged my graphics tablet in and began to use the pairs of images I'd captured early to remove objects from some of my photographs while leaving their shadows behind.

#### What I did

I followed a simple process. First I would open the original photograph in Photoshop. Then I would open the second image, taken from a similar angle, but at a different perspective.

In my layers pallet you can see the way I've cloned ,using a second image, the areas containing the street light out.

The images below show what was colned and what I used the second image to mask out. The image on the left hand side is what I achieved by masking the other photograph ontop of the orginal, a very rough result. The middle image shows the areas I have used the clone stamp tool to recreate, they don't look like much but when added with the first image they produce a <strong>perfect</strong> result, see right image.

![Photo with areas completely removed](/media/images/shadows/step-005.png")

Finaly I checked to see if I had left any parts of the image with obvious artifacts using the show edges filter.

Here is the result of well over an hour spent perfecting this technique in Photoshop.

<a onmouseover="document.shadow1.src='/media/images//shadows/after-01.jpg'" onmouseout="document.shadow1.src='/media/images//shadows/before-01.jpg'">
	<img src="/media/images/shadows/before-01.jpg" name="shadow1" alt="Shadows">
	<p>Roll over image to see the before and after</p>
</a>

<a onmouseover="document.shadow2.src='/media/images//shadows/after-02.jpg'" onmouseout="document.shadow2.src='/media/images//shadows/before-02.jpg'">
	<img src="/media/images/shadows/before-02.jpg" name="shadow2" alt="Shadows">
</a>

<br/>

<a onmouseover="document.shadow3.src='/media/images//shadows/after-03.jpg'" onmouseout="document.shadow3.src='/media/images//shadows/before-03.jpg'">
	<img src="/media/images/shadows/before-03.jpg" name="shadow3" alt="Shadows">
</a>

<br/>

<a onmouseover="document.shadow4.src='/media/images//shadows/after-04.jpg'" onmouseout="document.shadow4.src='/media/images//shadows/before-04.jpg'">
	<img src="/media/images/shadows/before-04.jpg" name="shadow4" alt="Shadows">
</a>

I thought, two of people and two of objects was a good balance.

## Miscellaneous summer work

I happened to break a light bulb a few days ago and have since become very attached to the remains. I collected up several different kinds of lightbulbs and started to think about what I could do with them. I made a few sketches, this was my resulting idea.

![My original sketch of the Energy Saving Water Slide](/media/images/shadows/original-sketch.jpg)

I really loved the idea, I felt it could make an amazingly cute illustration if I gave it enough time. And I gave it plenty about 4 and a half hours.

![The Energy Saving Water Slide basic shapes](/media/images/shadows/lightbulb-01.png")

The first step was to create all the shape layers in Photoshop with a sytlus. I then studied the light bulb closely in both photographs and real life so I could get the relfections on the surfaces just right.

The layers pallet was full to bursting with layers for each little reflection and piece of detail

Ta da! This is the finished reslut.
