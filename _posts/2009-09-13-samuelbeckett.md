A Portrait of Samuel Beckett by Jane Brown

## Compostion

This Photograph of Samuel Beckett was taken by Jane Brown. Beckett was a writer born in Ireland in 1906.

When we first look at the photograph our eyes a pulled strait to Samuel Beckett, the subject. The wooden planks on the right point towards his face, and the absolute black the surrounds him focuses the audience on his face. Becketts deep wrinkles guide our eyes. The furrows on his brow channel our eyes toward his, as do the lines around his eyes and mouth.

The wooden planks seem like rays of light, illuminating his face. However his face is unevenly lit, his wrinkles cast deep shadows accross his face. His right eye is very bright, and reflects the light source which is to the left behind the Photographer. Because of this the area to right, the right hand third, is lit while the left is not making the picture visually unballanced and creating intrest.

## Meaning

> Courage for the years of wandering     
> Through a world politely turning     
> From the loutishness of learning.     
> **Gnome, 1931**    

Samuel Beckett penned this poem after he read [Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Meister%27s_Apprenticeship)a novel about a young man leading a mundane life as a business man. He trys makes several attempts to escape his what he views as a tedious existance by acting and then going a mensa like society.

The poem itself is critical of life as a whole, with the first line being childhood, *"years of learning"*. Childern often have little respect for educationa and the success it can allow. In the second line of the poem, *"years of wandering"* relates to the time we will spend as adults and how we need to be brave as without out an education we are not prepared. The third and fourth lines refer to the world moving away from learning, towards a less pleasant, less civilised society. I think this poem is filled with wisdom that shines even today.

I think Samuel Beckett was a very wise man, who was without optimism for the world. I think his bleak look and piercing stare in this picture are symbolic of his views on society and the future.
