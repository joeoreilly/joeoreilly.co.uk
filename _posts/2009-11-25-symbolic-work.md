> I need to create an image of a journalist who's press pass is showing an note books are scattered on the floor and still hanging off of him with a police officer leaning on his back spraying him with CS spray or hitting him with a baton showing fierce anger and protest to section 44. The worst thing in the world. This needs to be done in Illustrator and it needs to be absolutely fantastic and 110% over the top as far as illustration and technique goes.


### Further Notes

The first key symbol in this image would be the journalist's cameras, these are strong symbols of power in the UK. CCTV surveillance is rampant and *celebs* are stalked by the paparazzi who carry powerful cameras whilst the authorities want the camera as a tool to use against us. [Section 44 of the Terrorism act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_Act_2000#Section_44_powers_.28stop_and_search.29) is being used against the people, if the police see someone with a camera they legally have the power to stop them, and take anything from them they want. All this was achieved under the guise of protecting us.

The next major symbol will be the police office himself, I reference to an earlier work where I changed the UK to German I will be swapping the name of the police to something more threatening. I think Polizei doesn't put the message across that I feel there are fascist connections so I will do some research into German war time policing and see if I can't get a better word.

I will be creating a Vanitas like piece, through out the image I want to remind the audience of the immediate nature that is longed for in our society and the often disastrous results of it. The journalist's blood will be splattered on the pavement, along with bits of broken dSLR lens. I intend to leave a page of the *victim's* note book open and rather than notes I want to see sketches of fat pigs, this will be a direct reference to the British Police force. I will no doubt have various other elements of the scene set up so as to provoke thought and intrigue around photographers rights, and more importantly the rights of the citizens.

I will be posing two models for this image so I can get the body positions correct as well as the lighting. One man will have a flouresant jacket on and be forcing the other to the floor. He will be the Police Officer, the other will be dressed neatly, and have lots of camera bags and a mock press pass around his neck.

[If you're angry that the police can stop anyone, at any time, and then confiscate anything because of a terrorism law designed to remove the last of our rights as citizens then sign this petition](http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/Simeon/)
