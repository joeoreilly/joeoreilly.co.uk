### A Year with Cancer

In April 2008 my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer, this as you can imagine was probably the worst news I've ever been given. On the upside she's past the worst of it as is getting better now. But 2008 was a really awful year at some points, it even caused me to drop out of school temporarily.

This expirence has caused me to think about creating a large illustration in the form of a triptych. The first image of the trio will be an illustration of a model with what is called a Hickman Line. This is placed in the upper chest and passed into the right ventrical (I think).

The second illustration will be of the same woman again, this time in a hospital gown. Her face will be noticably drained and her skin greyed.

The final of the three will be the woman, again marked up with the guides of radiotherapy.

**Please note this work is tangential to my study, I will work on it as a side line.**
