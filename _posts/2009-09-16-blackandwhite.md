### Brassa&iuml;

On the 9th of September 1899 Gyula Hal&aacute;sz was born Brass&oacute;, He would later become now as Brassa&iuml;, which means from Brass&oacute;.

Brassa&iuml; studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Budapest, he then served in the first World War. After the war he found work as a journalist in Paris where he live in the Montparnasse Quarter.

His first book, Paris de nuit, or Paris by night was published in 1933. Bellow are by favourite photographs from it.

Notra Dame from the Ile Saint-Louis, is my favourite photograph from the set. I really like the soft glow of the sreet ligths and how they contrast to the barely visable slihoute over the top of the Paris sky line. The small lit areas on the buildings allow us a glimpse at the detail of 1930s Paris.

<p>While colour photography had been around since the 1860s it was still cheaper to use a monochrome (black and white) camera. Often black and white photography requires more skill, as you have to give the image mood and life without the use of colour like a traditional photograph. The black and what images Brassa&iuml; created all have a slightly muddy brown hue to them, it makes them feel gritty and like they where taken with an almost dirty lens.</p>

###Selective Colour - Photography and Film

![Girl from Schindler's List](/media/images/baw/schindler.jpg)

Selective colour is a technique made popular by the film [Schindler's List](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108052/), uses a little girl's coat as the sole object of colour. [Sin City](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401792/) doesn't stick to one colour, but changes several times over the course of the film. The technique is one that is done in post process using Photoshop or Final Cut.
