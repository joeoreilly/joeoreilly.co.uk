### An excerpt from Frankenstein...

> **Chapter 5**
>
>It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.
>
>How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.
>
>The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness. But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams.

### Looking elsewhere for inspiration

After my first experiment I hit up a few of my favourite art blogs as they often show case work by <a href="http://www.behance.net/" title="Behance Network">AMAZING</a> illustrators. Below you can see <a href="http://www.denada.de/" title="Andreas Krapf">Andreas Krapf's</a> work, he's a talented illustrator who lives in Hettstadt, Germany. <a href="http://www.behance.net/Gallery/Brothers-Grimm-Fairy-Tales/416014" title="The Brothers Grimm">His work below</a> marries the words of The Brothers Grimm with his marvellous high quality illustrations. The text has been set to flow beautifully along side his illustrations.

[View image of page](/media/images/bros-grimm.jpg) or maybe [view actual page](http://www.behance.net/Gallery/Brothers-Grimm-Fairy-Tales/416014).

Andreas' illustrations capture the look, and feel I've been aiming for. So I will use his work as an inspiration for by next draft, I'll create a background texture for one page on paper and scan/photograph it into a book.

### Draft Two

![](/media/images/chapter5-2.png)

I got my sketchbook and started to do some drawing, as this is often a great way to experiment and being faster than creating something digital it's also easier.

<a href="/media/images/drawing-02.jpg" onmouseover="document.drawing2.src='/media/images/drawing-thumb-02b.jpg'" onmouseout="document.drawing2.src='/media/images/drawing-thumb-02.jpg'" title="Brick Archway" rel="milkbox:gallery"> <img src="/media/images/drawing-thumb-02.jpg" name="drawing2"> </a>
<a href="/media/images/drawing-03.jpg" onmouseover="document.drawing3.src='/media/images/drawing-thumb-03b.jpg'" onmouseout="document.drawing3.src='/media/images/drawing-thumb-03.jpg'" title="Brick Archway" rel="milkbox:gallery"> <img src="/media/images/drawing-thumb-03.jpg" name="drawing3"> </a>
<a href="/media/images/drawing-04.jpg" onmouseover="document.drawing4.src='/media/images/drawing-thumb-04b.jpg'" onmouseout="document.drawing4.src='/media/images/drawing-thumb-04.jpg'" title="Brick Archway" rel="milkbox:gallery"> <img src="/media/images/drawing-thumb-04.jpg" name="drawing4"> </a>

I positioned my illustration into the middle of two A4 pages, and added text on the right side. I then started work on the floor, wall and arch I'd planned. I opened Illustrator and imported my sketches.

I started to experiment with shapes and styles for the brick work. I used various gradients, strokes and shading techniques.

I drew out all of the bricks so I had a framework to build on.

<a onmouseover="document.arch.src='/media/images/illustrator-shapes2b.png'" onmouseout="document.arch.src='/media/images/illustrator-shapes2a.png'"><img name="arch" src="/media/images/illustrator-shapes2a.png"></a>

![](/media/images/illustrator-photoshop.png)

This process wasn't working as well as I'd have liked it to. The act of styling the bricks was looking to be a tedious job I didn't want to do. I decided I couldn't do any worse trying to create the desired affect in Photoshop. And while I was in Photoshop, I thought, I might as well use my graphics tablet.

### Digital Painting

I've done some very, very, limited digital painting before. So this is a kinda new area for me.
