### Le d&eacute;jeuner sur l'herbe</h3>
#### &Eacute;douard Manet</h4>

This work by &Eacute;douard Manet is called [Le d&eacute;jeuner sur l'herbe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_dÂŽjeuner_sur_l'herbe), which translates from French as The Lunch on the Grass. It was completed in the year 1863 under it's original title Le Bain.

The painting depicts two well dressed men relaxing on the grass in the forground with a naked woman. In the distance we can see a woman washing herslf in a way that makes us think she's been engaged in sexual activities with the two men. This leads us to assume this is true of the other woman as well.

The two womans clothes lie discarded in the forground, along with various fruits and some bread. As well as this there is a boat in the background that is rested up against the shore of the pond.

#### Symoblism in this image

This image is full of things that have deeper meanings that are revealed under closer inspection. Fore example, if you look closely at the hand of the right Man you might notice some smiliarities. If you mouse over the image below you can see how Manet's figure is in a nearly identical pose to Adam in, [The Creation of Adam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Creation_of_Adam). I feel this choice by Manet was intended to make us feel a connection to Adam, or all of the male side of the species.</p>
