## Genotype 10

The vehicle with genotype 10 <code>[0 1 0 1]</code> has two inhibitory connections from the left sensor to the left wheel and from the right sensor to the right wheel.

This setup causes the any light sources to the vehicles lefthand side to cause it to back away towards the right, and any light sources to the right cause the inverse.

In this video you can see this behaviour when the world is drawn and the vehicles are spawned near light sources.
