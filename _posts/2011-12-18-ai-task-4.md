#### Approach an obstacle and stop	

Using the first algorithm in the lecture notes I built a program to move towards an obstacle until the sensor reading below a certain value.

	loop


Loop Control

![](/media/images/forward-until-det.png)

You can see there is one main loop, containing a sensor block and a compare block. The result of this comparision is then used to decide if the robot should move forwards or not. You can control the distance the robot wants to be at inside the compare block. The loop exits when the robot is closer than the tested distance away.

I went on to build a program to test the second alogrithm from the lecture notes.


#### Algorithm Two

![](/media/images/forward-until-2-mb.png)

Pseudo Code

	while distance < 20cm
		var distance = ultrasonic sensor reading
	
		if distance > 20cm
			switch motors on to move forward
		else
			switch motors off

	loop

This algorithm contains two possible actions, move forwards and stop. When the robot reaches its target goal it stops when it hasn't reached its goal it moves forwards.


#### Algorithm Three

![](/media/images/forward-until-3-mb.png)

Pseudo Code

	while true
		var distance = ultrasonic sensor reading
		
		if distance > 20cm
			switch motors on to move forwards
		else
			switch motors off
			
	loop


#### Algorithm Four

![](/media/images/forward-until-4-mb.png)

Pseudo Code

	while true
		var distance = ultrasonic sensor reading

			if distance > 20cm
				switch motors on to move forwards
			else
				if distance < 20cm
					switch motors on to move backwards
				else
					switch all motors off
					
	loop

#### Observations of these Algorithms

* Alogirthm 1 moving in bursts meant it often either overshoot its target. No correction for overshoots.
* Alogirthm 2 still moved in bursts, it didn't overshoot its target my as much as 1. No correction for overshoots.
* Alogirthm 3 moving continuously and reading was temperamental but if. No correction for overshoots.
* Alogirthm 4 again continuous reading/moving was temperamental but correction for overshoots meant this worked best.

Note: Slowing any of these alogirths down results in large improvements, reading is more accurate when the robot is slow as the bounce time for the sound more accurately reflects the actual distance.

### 4.2

#### Station-Keeping	

The final algorthim from the last section proved fairly effective at this task however we had an idea of a better solution, here is the pseudo code as the actuall program is rather large

	while true
		var power = sensor reading - goal distance

			if sensor reading = 20cm
				stop
			else 
				if power < 0
					move backwards at ((power * -1) + 15)
				else
					move forwards at (power + 15)

		loop

### 4.3

#### Wall-Following	

Here is our wall following alogrithm expressed in pseudo code, too large in NXT software.

Reactive Control Algorithm

	var previous = sensor reading
	var current
	
	move forwards 0 .5 rotations

	while true
		
		current = sensor reading
		
		if current > 30 //on the right of the goal line
			if (current - previous) > 0 //moving further away from goal
				turn slightly to the left and go forward 0 .5 rotations
			else  //moving towards the goal
				go straight ahead for 0 .5 rotations
		else //on the left of the goal line
			if (current – previous) &lt; 0 //moving further away from goal
				turn slightly to the right and go forward 0 .5 rotations
		else //moving towards the goal
			go straight ahead for 0 .5 rotations
			
		current to previous

	loop

It preformed very well at all distances, and didn't do anything unexpected like turning itself around.

Proportional Control Algorithm

	var previous = sensor reading
	var current
	
	let gain = 0.4
	let goal = 20 // Distance we want to keep to

	while true

		current = sensor readings

		if current in range [-1..goal..+1]
			forwards(1)
		else

		if current > goal
			if current < previous
				forwards(1)
			else
				turn(current - goal * gain * -1)
		else
			if current < previous
				forwards(1)
			else
				turn(current - goal * gain)

		previous = current			

		handlebump()

	loop


Proportional Derivative Control Algorithm

	var previous = sensor reading
	var current

	var derivative = 0

	let p-gain = 0.4
	let d-gain = 0.5

	while true

		current sensor reading

		derivative = (derivative + current) / 2

		if current in range goal±1
			forwards(1)
		else

		if current > goal
			if current < previous
				forwards(1)
			else
				turn (((current - goal) * gain) * (derivative * d-gain) *  -1)
		else
			if current < previous
				forwards(1)
			else
				turn (((current - goal) * gain) * (derivative * d-gain))

		previous = sensor reading

		handlebump()

	loop
