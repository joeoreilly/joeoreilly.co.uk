title: Skin - Study

My illustration of my uncle as the Monster from Frankenstein isn't finished. I don't like how the skin looks, it's too realistic, and I think I should spend some time taking the skin textures to the next level. To do this I have had to download some high quality skin textures, as I couldn't get my camera to focus close enough and light it properly.

### Failed Skin Photos

I set up my room using a large sheet of paper (for an even background), switched on all the spotlights opened the curtains and set up my slide projector for some added directional lighting. I asked my sister to be my first modle, I took some high res photos of her arm.

I used my Gorilla pod to steady the camera and the timer so as to get the results possible. I also positioned a mirror to reflect some of the light back onto her arm.

Here are the best photographs I captured. Click on them to enlarge. The second image is my favourite.

After this, I tried again with my Girlfriend.

### Downloaded Textures

Because of the lack of success I've had creating my own textures I've been forced to supliment my good image with some **harvested** from Google Image search. Below are the ones I chose. Click to enlarge them.

### The Process

I began with the first texture, I used Photoshop to stress the skin and add colour to make the skin appear rotten.

**Step One**

**Step Two**

I then used a layer mask to make it appear as if the skin was broken.

The layers.

I used the filter gallery to create a stressed version of the original skin, which you can see below. I then masked it to only show an area around the cut. I also made the skin redder inside the "cut".

This process had potential, but it wasn't working quite right. So I started again, working quickly now I new the process.

I think this looks far better than before! I'm guna roll with it.

I worked a bit of shading in and got my final result.

The goal of this work was to create something I could feed into my second illustration. I'm hopefully going to be able to use this to make the skin look rotten, dead and like it's been joined, poorly. :D
