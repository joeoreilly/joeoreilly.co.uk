I spent some time looking online for inspiration, I stopped looking when I found this illustrators [web site](http://www.martinansin.com/). His style absolutely amazed me, so I've decided that I want to try and emulate his style. Currently I work at a very detailed and over the top levels when I use illustrator. I think it would be nice to try and create work the stems from my style but has more **WOW** factor.

I find that when I work I create things that are great to look at, but they are often lacking in atmosphere.
