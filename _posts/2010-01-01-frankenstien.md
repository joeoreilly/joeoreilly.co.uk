### My ideas on my personal work

My study has centered around icons, symbols and illustration. To extend my personal work I want to illustrate an amazing novel, Frankenstein, with my own hand. Working only from my ideas of what The Monster, Doctor Frankenstein and the other characters look like. To get myself started I visited my Uncle who happens to be very tall and well built and explained I want to use him as the base for my monster. Being very kind and understanding he let me photograph him.

### The Plan

![](/media/images/the_monster.jpg)

I plan to illustrate three key scenes from within the book as to illustarte it completely would take far to long. I can also focus more attention on each illustration this way, with much better results. The three scenes I want to create illustrations for are:

* When Walton and Frankenstein meet abord the boat.
* When the Moster is given life
* When the Moster walks of into the deep north to die.

I think that while my first and last choices aren't huge milestones in the story, I think they'll be fun to illustrate and to work with.

### The Illustration Process

![](/media/images/frank-illustration-01.png)

I opened the image I picked and set up my work space.

![](/media/images/frank-illustration-02.png)

I created outlines of all of the major shapes, torso, hands, feet and head. I then started work on the legs as they are the biggest area in the image. I used soft black and white shapes to add tone to the trousers and sharp black objects of details.

<br>Roll over me to see a detailed view of shapes
</a>

I carried on creating more layers and more complexity. Working in detail on the hands for some time.

I'm really pleased with the hands.

<a onmouseover="document.hand.src='/media/images/frank-illustration-05b.png'" onmouseout="document.hand.src='/media/images/frank-illustration-05a.png'">
<img src="/media/images/frank-illustration-05a.png" name="hand">
<br />Roll over me to see a detailed view of shapes
</a>

I didn't spend hours with the hair as I felt that I was probably going to change the look of it later to make it feel more like  the monster had been dead for some time.

<a onmouseover="document.hair.src='/media/images/frank-illustration-06b.png'" onmouseout="document.hair.src='/media/images/frank-illustration-06a.png'">
<img src="/media/images/frank-illustration-06a.png" name="hair">
<br />Roll over me to see a detailed view of shapes
</a>

I carried on working with illustrator adding complexity and detail where needed, finishing up with the face. I spent a considerable amount of time on shading,  as this had been a source of ciritism before.

The face began to take shape.

I approached the end of the illustration.

<a onmouseover="document.over.src='/media/images/frank-illustration-10b.png'" onmouseout="document.over.src='/media/images/frank-illustration-10a.png'">
<img src="/media/images/frank-illustration-10a.png" name="over">
<br />Roll over me to see a detailed view of shapes
</a>

After adding the eyes to the illustration I declared myself finished!

<a onmouseover="document.finished.src='/media/images/frank-illustration-11b.png'" onmouseout="document.finished.src='/media/images/frank-illustration-11a.png'" rel="milkbox" href="images/frank-normal.png" title="Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus">
<img src="/media/images/frank-illustration-11a.png" name="finished">
<br />Roll over me to see a detailed view of shapes
</a>

### Criticism

A few points with my work that I'd like to improve upon, and to or change.

1. I think the resulting illustration really needs to look more monstrous. Currently I have not worked any of my [research](/2010/01/21/skin-study/) or [practice](/2010/02/02/hand-study/) into a completed illustration, so this is my main goal for my second illustration.
2. This illustration was inspired by the book Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus by Mary Shelly. I should really make an effort at working the text of the book into the illustration, or the illustration into the text.
3. Even more detail! I think I should make it my ambition to have even more detail in my next illustration.
